<p>This is a brainstorming tool I made that generates random words.</p>
<p>It should help spark your imagination if you're looking to think up a domain name, a band name, a project name or whatever.</p>
<p>Right now it generates 6 random words but I'll be revising it in the months ahead so that you can choose the number of words.</p>
<p>I just have to wait for life to install the spare time module.</p>
<p>Once you click the generate button, the random words will appear just below the button. Have fun brainstorming.</p>
